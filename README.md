- Real-time area feedback as you digitize
- Automatic prevention of exceeding target area

‚ú® **Edit Existing Polygons**
- Move existing vertices with area constraints
- Add new vertices by clicking on polygon edges
- Visual feedback with color-coded vertex markers

‚ú® **Flexible Units**
- Support for square meters (m¬≤) and hectares (ha)
- Easy unit conversion with dropdown selector

## Installation

### From QGIS Plugin Repository (Recommended)
1. Open QGIS
2. Go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Manage and Install Plugins`
3. Search for "Area Limiter"
4. Click `Install Plugin`

### Manual Installation

2. Extract the ZIP file to your QGIS plugins directory:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\`
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/`
3. Restart QGIS
4. Enable the plugin in `Plugins` ‚Üí `Manage and Install Plugins`

## Usage

### Creating a New Polygon

1. **Select a polygon layer** from the dropdown or activate one in QGIS
2. **Put the layer in edit mode** (click the pencil icon)
3. **Set your target area** using the spin box
4. **Choose units** (m¬≤ or ha)
5. **Click "Apply"** to start digitizing
6. **Left-click** to add vertices
7. **Right-click** (or press Enter) to finish the polygon

The plugin will prevent you from adding vertices that would exceed the target area.

### Editing an Existing Polygon

1. **Select a polygon layer** and put it in edit mode
2. **Select a single polygon feature** in QGIS
3. **Set your target area** 
4. **Click "Edit Selected"**
5. **Move vertices**: Click and drag blue vertex markers
6. **Add vertices**: Click on any polygon edge (turns green)
7. **Right-click** (or press Enter) to save changes
8. **Press Escape** to cancel editing

## Requirements

- QGIS 3.0 or higher
- Python 3.6+
